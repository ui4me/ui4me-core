//! The abstractions that make up the core of Taffy's low-level API
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! The following examples demonstrate end-to-end implementation of Taffy's traits and usage of the low-level compute APIs:
//!
//!   - [custom_tree_vec](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/blob/main/examples/custom_tree_vec.rs) which implements a custom Taffy tree using a `Vec` as an arena with NodeId's being index's into the Vec.
//!   - [custom_tree_owned_partial](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/blob/main/examples/custom_tree_owned_partial.rs) which implements a custom Taffy tree using directly owned children with NodeId's being index's into vec on parent node.
//!   - [custom_tree_owned_unsafe](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/blob/main/examples/custom_tree_owned_unsafe.rs) which implements a custom Taffy tree using directly owned children with NodeId's being pointers.
//!

//! ## All of the traits on one page
//!
//! ### TraversePartialTree and TraverseTree
//! These traits are Taffy's abstraction for downward tree traversal:
//!  - [`TraversePartialTree`] allows access to a single container node, and it's immediate children. This is the only "traverse" trait that is required
//!    for use of Taffy's core layout algorithms (flexbox, grid, etc).
//!  - [`TraverseTree`] is a marker trait which uses the same API signature as `TraversePartialTree`, but extends it with a guarantee that the child/children methods can be used to recurse
//!    infinitely down the tree. It is required by the `RoundTree` and
//!    the `PrintTree` traits.
//! ```rust
//! # use taffy::*;
//! pub trait TraversePartialTree {
//!     /// Type representing an iterator of the children of a node
//!     type ChildIter<'a>: Iterator<Item = NodeId>
//!     where
//!         Self: 'a;
//!
//!     /// Get the list of children IDs for the given node
//!     fn child_ids(&self, parent_node_id: NodeId) -> Self::ChildIter<'_>;
//!
//!     /// Get the number of children for the given node
//!     fn child_count(&self, parent_node_id: NodeId) -> usize;
//!
//!     /// Get a specific child of a node, where the index represents the nth child
//!     fn get_child_id(&self, parent_node_id: NodeId, child_index: usize) -> NodeId;
//! }
//!
//! pub trait TraverseTree: TraversePartialTree {}
//! ```
//!
//! You must implement [`TraversePartialTree`] to access any of Taffy's low-level API. If your tree implementation allows you to implement [`TraverseTree`] with
//! the correct semantics (full recursive traversal is available) then you should.
//!
//! ### LayoutPartialTree
//!
//! **Requires:** `TraversePartialTree`<br />
//! **Enables:** Flexbox, Grid, Block and Leaf layout algorithms from the [`crate::compute`] module
//!
//! Any type that implements [`LayoutPartialTree`] can be laid out using [Taffy's algorithms](crate::compute)
//!
//! Note that this trait extends [`TraversePartialTree`] (not [`TraverseTree`]). Taffy's algorithm implementations have been designed such that they can be used for a laying out a single
//! node that only has access to it's immediate children.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use taffy::*;
//! pub trait LayoutPartialTree: TraversePartialTree {
//!     /// Get a reference to the [`Style`] for this node.
//!     fn get_style(&self, node_id: NodeId) -> &Style;
//!
//!     /// Set the node's unrounded layout
//!     fn set_unrounded_layout(&mut self, node_id: NodeId, layout: &Layout);
//!
//!     /// Get a mutable reference to the [`Cache`] for this node.
//!     fn get_cache_mut(&mut self, node_id: NodeId) -> &mut Cache;
//!
//!     /// Compute the specified node's size or full layout given the specified constraints
//!     fn compute_child_layout(&mut self, node_id: NodeId, inputs: LayoutInput) -> LayoutOutput;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### RoundTree
//!
//! **Requires:** `TraverseTree`
//!
//! Trait used by the `round_layout` method which takes a tree of unrounded float-valued layouts and performs
//! rounding to snap the values to the pixel grid.
//!
//! As indicated by it's dependence on `TraverseTree`, it required full recursive access to the tree.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use taffy::*;
//! pub trait RoundTree: TraverseTree {
//!     /// Get the node's unrounded layout
//!     fn get_unrounded_layout(&self, node_id: NodeId) -> Layout;
//!     /// Get a reference to the node's final layout
//!     fn set_final_layout(&mut self, node_id: NodeId, layout: &Layout);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### PrintTree
//!
//! **Requires:** `TraverseTree`
//!
//! ```rust
//! /// Trait used by the `print_tree` method which prints a debug representation
//! ///
//! /// As indicated by it's dependence on `TraverseTree`, it required full recursive access to the tree.
//! # use taffy::*;
//! pub trait PrintTree: TraverseTree {
//!     /// Get a debug label for the node (typically the type of node: flexbox, grid, text, image, etc)
//!     fn get_debug_label(&self, node_id: NodeId) -> &'static str;
//!     /// Get a reference to the node's final layout
//!     fn get_final_layout(&self, node_id: NodeId) -> Layout;
//! }
//! ```
